# What is this?

This repository is a collection of coding challenges for learning Embedded Systems.

# Getting started

To get going, create a codespace instance on the main branch of this repository. Wait until the environment is setup.

## Test

Once ready, open a terminal. Execute the following:
```
cd 1/
gcc main.c
checkbrah
```

You should see some stats relating to tests being run. You can implement the `TODO` in the `main.c` file. Compile it and rerun `checkbrah` on repeat until all tests pass.

`tests.yaml` has the tests.
